## Known Bugs and Other Issues
1. If you are on the "Profile" page and click on "About" in the navigation bar you are taken to the home page. However, if you click on "About" again, you will be taken to the about page.
2. Images of volunteer postions are taken from the Internet via a link. These links may not work or may expire which will result in the image not showing up. Sometimes refreshing the page resolves this issue, however if something more permanant happened to the image such as the orginal website creator deleted the image from their website, the image may not show up.
