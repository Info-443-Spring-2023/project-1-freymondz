# Introduction
FutureForward is a University of Washington INFO 442 web-app project created and designed to address UN Sustainable Development Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities. We designed an implemented FutureForward to focus on increasing availability and accessibility of volunteering opportunities for highschool students in an effort to make cities more inclusive, resiliant and sustainable.

**Our Problem Statement:** How might we help high school students discover local volunteering opportunities that align with their interests to better serve their community?

# About FutureForward
Futureforward's mission is to connect highschool students to volunteering opportunities that resonate with their passions and interests along with their physical needs and abilities. FutureForward aims to provide opportunties that people can activitely participate in regardless of physical abilities. 

All volunteer positions available were sourced by the Future5 team to ensure that the position requirements would fit the needs and interests of our target users. We sourced a variety of positions to ensure that these needs were met and that the user had varying options.

The positions and organizations we sourced for volunteering opportuntities were spread across a variety of topics included but not limited to:
- Eduacation
- Homelessness
- The arts
- Environment
- Senior care
- Health

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
