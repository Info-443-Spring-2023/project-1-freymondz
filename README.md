## Created by: Duy Nguyen, Audrey Dennis, Jared Lim, Liliana Garcia, and Ria Antony

## Introduction

FutureForward is a University of Washington INFO 442 web-app project created and designed to address UN Sustainable Development Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities. We designed an implemented FutureForward to focus on increasing availability and accessibility of volunteering opportunities for highschool students in an effort to make cities more inclusive, resiliant and sustainable.

**Our Problem Statement:** How might we help high school students discover local volunteering opportunities that align with their interests to better serve their community?

The site is hosted at: <https://future5-7a3d2.web.app/>

## About FutureForward

Futureforward's mission is to connect highschool students to volunteering opportunities that resonate with their passions and interests along with their physical needs and abilities. FutureForward aims to provide opportunties that people can activitely participate in regardless of physical abilities.

All volunteer positions available were sourced by the Future5 team to ensure that the position requirements would fit the needs and interests of our target users. We sourced a variety of positions to ensure that these needs were met and that the user had varying options.

The positions and organizations we sourced for volunteering opportuntities were spread across a variety of topics included but not limited to:

- Eduacation
- Homelessness
- The arts
- Environment
- Senior care
- Health
